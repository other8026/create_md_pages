# create_md_pages

This Rust executable does basically one thing: it takes a bunch of yaml files and creates an `.md` file out of them.

The name sounds super multipurpose, but it's not. It's only for one real purpose: make an app compatibility page for
another repo here: other8026/community-docs

The idea is upon an update to the repository, this program will be run to create an up-to-date page so anyone who wants
to update the apps doesn't have to run this on their own computer.
